            </div>According to USGS:
 An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth&rsquo;s crust and cause the shaking that we feel.
 Earthquake size can be very weak which can‚Äôt be felt to those which can destroy cities.]]></description></item><item><title>Organized Global Azure Bootcamp 2019</title><link>http://diwashrestha.com.np/posts/global-azure-bootcamp-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2019 23:29:14 +0545</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://diwashrestha.com.np/posts/global-azure-bootcamp-2019/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">
