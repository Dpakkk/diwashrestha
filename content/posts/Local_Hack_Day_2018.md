There were 40 participants in the event and they worked in a group to solve the data problem. They presented their insights using reports, graphs and presentation. Every group were given a certificate of participation in [MLH](https://mlh.io/)  Local HackDay DataHackthon by Data Scientist [Saurav Paudel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurav-poudel-34a65688/?originalSubdomain=np). There were some swags and stickers provided by the MLH team and we shared with participants and guest. Overall the event was successful and it was a great experience to organize such a great global event.
