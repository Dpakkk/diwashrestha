Last year I participated on the Hacktoberfest 2018 and learned about open source culture and community.

> Hacktoberfest is a worldwide celebration of open source software and is open for everyone! It is all about encouraging meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem, for beginners and veterans alike.

Hacktoberfest is yearly open event which is oraganized by DigitalOcean on month of October. I first participated in Hacktoberfest 2018 and did more than 10 pull request out of which some got merged. Finally, I got my Hacktoberfest swags from digitalocean.

#### Hactoberfest

Partcipating in Hactoberfest helped me alot to learn new things and new projects. I was motivated to host a Hacktoberfest meetup in Kathmandu. I and Binod Jung Bogati Organized the Hacktoberfest Kathmandu Meetup.

In the meetup participants learned about the git and github by sending pull request to the [hacktm.js.org](https://hacktm.js.org/) project. We also shared some cool swags with participants.
