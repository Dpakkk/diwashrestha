We from DataSansar Team attended the Solveathon 2019 for solving social problems with data driven solutions.
Solveathon 2019 was a two-day event, organized by the World Bank, The Asia Foundation and supported by the UKaid at the Kathmandu University School of Management on 14-15 December.

The event was organized to find the data driven solutions to social issues through community collaboration using the open data and open source technology.

The first day of the event start by introducing with other participants and the organizers. The participants were divided in groups based on their projects.
Our team was working on the tourism sector problem. As Visit Nepal 2020 was approaching, our team decided to work on the Nepal Tourism Dashboard Project. Our Project was to create a solution which can help governmental bodies in planning and decision-making around the tourism sector. Our team worked on the problem definition, solutions and possible beneficiaries. After designing the solution, we started coding the solution in Rstudio using R and data from the Nepal Tourism Board.

#### Day 2

We built the prototype of our solution using R and Flexdashboard with different interactive visualizations and maps showing information about the tourism sector of Nepal.
